This repository is divided into repositories 1a, 1b, 2 and 3. Through this project a glassfish application that connects to a postgres sql database and that it is deployed through different linux machines will be developed and its performance meausured, tested and improved.

Throug repository 1a I start getting in touch with elements of the JAVA EE architecture, to a multitier system(GUI, application and RDBMs). The application developed uses JSP, Servlets and JavaBeans. It is also used JDBC to connect to the database. In this first repository I also work throught the technology of Web Services and automatitation of work and deploy with ant.

Through repository1b I keep understanding the insights of the JAVA EE architecture. I work through the business logic through EJBs session stateless. I also work through queue manager and API JMS for the communication between JAVA EE applications. Also I work through the Message Driven Beans(MDBs).

Through repository 2, the performace of the JAVA EE application is measured. I work through aspects of performance in JAVA EE applications, influence of the configuration of the server of applications in the performance, processing chain within the application server, elements that compose it, glue points, obtaining the productivity curve, application server configuration for performance, performance evaluation mechanisms and unit tests and stress tests of a JAVA EE application: automation of a test plan with the JMETER tool.

Through repository 3, it is reviewed general aspects of clustering,  configuration of a cluster, implementation of a secure cluster and availability tests of a J2EE application.
